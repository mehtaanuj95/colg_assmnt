NOTE: take the time slot of 1 unit each. You can read the data of files only after they have arrived. For Eg:at time t=0 you can read the data of cars arriving at only t=0 i.e C1, C2 and C3. Then time slot increases to t=1 at which no one arrives and when eventually time becomes t=2 then only you can read data of cars C4,C5,C6 and C7.Likewise is the case for all the cars.
